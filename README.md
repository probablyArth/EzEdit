<i>Edit Docx for free</i>

## Problem Statement

We all know how to edit documents on Word. However, to date, there's no good open source implementation of a .docx editor in npm/javascript. Most solutions out there are paid -- the goal is to make something better and free for the world to use.

## Solution

A webapp with rich text editor to edit the docx file and translate that to html and ability to download as docx file.

Still there are a lot of missing formattings like equations, videos due to lack of library support, but it works good as a general document editor.
